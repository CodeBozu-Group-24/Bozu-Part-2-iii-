Things, The Impact, Positivity(%)
Obamacare," The health exchanges didn't collapse, as Trump had hoped. Instead, health plans and states quickly figured out a way to claw back the federal dollars they lost: They built the costs of the subsidies into premiums for Obamacares benchmark silver policies. This meant that premiums for these silver plans spiked and as a result, the premium subsidies the government had to pay for low-income enrollees vastly increased. The concept, known as silver-loading, grew government subsidizing of the exchanges by upwards of $20 billion per year. ",5.1
Strategy," Already it has led to a reordering of the Pentagon budget and new investments supported by a bipartisan majority in Congress, including billions of dollars to beef up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific. ",6.3
Coronavirus," The agencys backseat approach to workplace safety means Americans still face a dangerously unpredictable range of safety conditions when they show up to work. Though OSHA has cited some companies for coronavirus-related transgressions, many large corporations received meager fines even in cases where workers died from Covid-19. Democrats have attempted to include language mandating an emergency temporary standard in future rounds of pandemic aid  but their efforts have been unsuccessful.",4.9
Oversight," The foot-dragging in providing even basic information stretched to written requests from Congress and the public. House Democrats complained that Interior, in responding to written questions, would flood the zone with thousands of documents that had little relation to the topic at hand and even include pages containing nothing but Wingdings font. Interior was also sued by outside groups and subject to an internal watchdog audit over complaints it was slow walking public information requests. ",2.6
Cannabis," Cannabis is now legal in some form in 36 states, meaning that a majority of Americans have some form of legal access even though the drug remains officially illegal at the federal level. In fact, more than one-third of Americans now live in states with full legalization.",5.8999999999999995
Loan forgiveness, Borrowers seeking to have their loans wiped out because of the misconduct of their college  such as misleading or deceiving students about their job prospects  will have a tougher time proving their claims. The Education Department estimates that the Trump policy will reduce federal loan forgiveness by hundreds of millions of dollars each year. ,9.700000000000001
Shell companies," The information businesses report to the Treasury Department would be accessible to law enforcement agencies that would have an unprecedented tool to investigate shell companies. Banks, which are responsible for policing criminal activity by their customers, would also be able to tap into the database.",8.3
Poverty," 755,000 Americans have lost their access to food aid under SNAP, according to the USDAs own estimates. ",0.0
Overtime pay," The Trump rule applies to just 15 percent of full-time, salaried workers, whereas the Obama rule would have applied to twice as many. Thats at least 8 million workers who would have been eligible for overtime pay under the 2016 version and now are ineligible; some estimates place the amount of wages lost at around $1 billion annually.",0.0
Greenhouse gases," Trumps stance was the polar opposite of what China and European countries pledged to do to rein in emissions of a gas considered one of the leading causes of climate change. The Trump rollbacks, finalized in August, were considered so out of the norm that even oil companies such as BP and Shell publicly spoke out against them. The French government stepped in to force trading firm Engie, in which it owns a stake, to reject a proposed contract to import U.S. gas, citing reputational risk. Trumps rejection of strict methane standards has also allowed Europe to claim the global mantle for fighting climate change. ",0.0
Drones," DJIs placement on the trade blacklist doesnt affect ordinary consumers or businesses, but its a significant blow to U.S. companies, such as Microsoft and PrecisionHawk, who do business with DJI including provide components for their drones. This is bad timing for those companies, since the FAA is getting ready to greenlight new commercial uses, such as drone-based delivery services, which will increase sales. Whats more, Congress may soon put even more restrictions on use of Chinese-made technology because of security concerns.",12.5
Defense spending," In the end, as widely expected, the Pentagon failed the audit overall; too much paperwork was missing or incomplete. Officials now predict the Defense Department wont be able to pass a full audit until 2027 at the earliest. But there are bright spots: for example, the first time around the military pay system, an enormous stream of dollars, came back clean. In follow-up audits conducted in 2019 and 2020, meanwhile, a few more defense agencies and military components were added to the clean column. ",15.0
Taxes," The tax cuts helped goose the economy before the coronavirus struck, as unemployment fell steeply and the economy expanded, though many economists argued it was a sugar high or questioned whether a direct line could be drawn between the cuts and the good times. Also, the economic impact wasnt all good  the tax cuts also fueled record deficits. Supporters inside and outside the Trump administration still insist the cuts will pay for themselves in the long run through economic growth  though many economists are skeptical, or outright dismissive, of that prediction. ",10.100000000000001
Robocalls," The volume of robocalls in 2020 seems to be on track to be lower than the previous two years, although the global pandemic could be affecting the numbers in ways not immediately apparent (not to mention prompting scams specific to Covid-19). ",0.0
Climate science," Perdues contentious decision to relocate hundreds of scientists to Kansas City was among the reasons morale has been so low among department employees, prompting many of them to jump ship, leaving research agencies with a fraction of their former staff. ",0.0
Medical records," Not much, yet. Providers and other parts of the industry successfully argued that complying with the rules would be too heavy a lift amid the pandemic, so the Trump administration has delayed the effective date. ",15.1
Sexual harassment, Federal contractors with a history of sexual harassment or other labor violations can win bids without having to reveal their problematic history.,12.0
Auto emissions," Vehicle emissions represent the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and the rollback was likely the biggest climate-related action of Trumps term, especially as electric utilities continue to move away from coal on their own and as electric vehicles are slow to take hold in the U.S. But some of the effect was mitigated when the state of California brokered a deal with five major auto manufacturers to meet standards similar to the Obama-era ones.",0.0
Antitrust," Its too soon to tell whether the antitrust actions will succeed in forcing changes at Google or Facebook, but they have sent a signal that there will be more scrutiny of their business practices going forward. ",5.7
Immigration," Some changes  including those that narrow the definition of a ""specialty occupation"" and that require employers to pay foreign workers more  were expected to reduce the number of approved H-1B visa petitions by one-third. Those efforts have since been halted in court. Businesses seeking these non-immigrant worker visas also saw an increase in requests to provide more evidence in their applications and a higher rate of visa denials. ",8.7
Toxic chemicals," The administrations approach paves the way for less stringent regulation of toxic chemicals. If the Biden EPA leaves the laxer evaluations intact, its subsequent regulations will not be able to limit certain ways people are exposed  meaning Americans may not get comprehensive protection. While it is likely the Biden administration will take a more holistic look at future chemicals EPA reviews, it is unclear whether it will have time to re-analyze the chemicals the Trump administration already finished reviewing.",4.6
Internet upgrade," Trump notched victories in countries like Britain and Australia, who made decisions to reject Huawei from their domestic 5G buildouts. The administration also nailed down plans to force smaller U.S. telecom carriers to rip out and replace any scattered gear from Huawei and ZTE being used in their networks. ",4.8
Farm aid," The vast majority of the aid went to traditional row crop farmers, many of whom were part of Trumps political base. Government payments are forecast to be at their highest level ever and account for nearly 40 percent net farm income this year. ",0.0
Banking," Since the passage of the legislation, large banks that lobbied for the looser restrictions have begun to merge. SunTrust and BB&T combined in 2019 to form Truist, the eighth-biggest U.S. bank at more than $504.3 billion in assets. PNC, the countrys 10th-largest lender, agreed to buy the U.S. operations of BBVA to form another mega-bank.",6.7
Social media, Pressure from Trump prompted the Federal Communications Commission to launch a controversial rulemaking process to clarify the scope of Section 230. The Justice Department unveiled its own proposal to pare it back. And congressional Republicans once wary of changing the law have rallied around Trumps efforts by introducing bills to do just that.,5.8999999999999995
Environmental impacts, New projects can be more polluting or damaging to the environment over the long term and still be approved  and community groups will have less leverage to challenge them. ,11.200000000000001
Artificial intelligence," Even as Trump disengaged from other areas of international rulemaking, his actions helped give the U.S. a global presence in the international debate over how to regulate AI. ",0.0
Housing segregation," The reduced focus on fair housing comes as the gap in homeownership rates between Black and white Americans yawns as widely as it ever has, including when housing discrimination was legal. About 70 percent of white households own their homes, compared with about 40 percent of Black households  a disparity the ongoing and lopsided economic crisis is expected to exacerbate.",5.800000000000001
Trade rules, Trump elevated concerns about Chinas trade practices and acquisition of American technology to a new level and helped usher in what many now are calling a cold war between the worlds two largest economies. He also weakened the World Trade Organization through his willingness to hamstring the groups dispute settlement system and to unilaterally impose tariffs to punish trading partners and protect domestic industries. ,6.2
Religion in schools,"Many religious education groups praised DeVos changes, which she often described as effort to expand religious liberty. Too many misinterpret the separation of church and state as an invitation for government to separate people from their faith, she said.",19.8
